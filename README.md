# Webscrape_project_1

The task given is the following : 
Write a Python algorithm that finds websites with the format `https://12695.portal.athenahealth.com/` and runs through the different variations of that and then pulls the practice name on the site into an Excel file.

Every site has the same format "welcome to the _ patient portal"- so we would just need the algorithm to run through all the different available variations of the URL format and then pull the URL and the portal and the "welcome to the _ patient portal" part of the site into an excel file.
